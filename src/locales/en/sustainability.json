        "description": "One of the main challenges in the manufacturing industry is eliminating the use of solvents due to their environmental impact and health risks. Since 2017, Glover Plant has implemented water-based inks, sealers and lacquers in 90% of its products, and 100% of the furniture line and bed and sofa legs. This change improved the painting process, eliminating flammability risks, reducing toxicity and worker exposure to hazardous substances. The system includes drying with hot air, IR and UV lamps, which increases the durability of the inks. Benefits include reduction of polluting emissions, lower carbon footprint, and safer and easier to treat waste."
