      "Protection against moisture and stains: Water-based sealers form a protective layer that reduces moisture absorption and facilitates surface cleaning, protecting it from liquids and dirt.",
      "Greater mechanical durability: Thermal curing (with hot air or IR lamps) and final UV light curing hardens the applied layer, providing greater resistance to scratching, wear, and daily abrasion.",
      "Finish stability: These formulations have good adhesion and flexibility, preventing the finish from cracking or peeling with temperature or humidity changes."
